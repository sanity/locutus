 * For example:
 * <code>
 *   int k = 32;
 *   int n = 256;
 *   FECCode code = FECCodeFactory.getDefault().createFECCode(k,n);
 * </code>
 *
 * All FEC
 * implementations will sublcass FECCode and implement the encode/decode
 * methods.  All codes implemented by this interface are assumed to be
 * systematic codes which means that the first k repair packets will be
 * the same as the original source packets.
