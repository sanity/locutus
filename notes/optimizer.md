### Data retention optimizer

Factors:
 * Data distance from location (further assumes lower - PAV)
 * Data age (older assumes lower - PAV)
 * Individual data request frequency

Combined and deconvolved.

 Predict:
 * Request frequency

Used to determine which we should subscribe to, to facilitate instant responses.

### Peer routing optimization

Factors:
 * Peer distance (PAV aggregate)
 * Peer actual

 Predict:
 * Success probability
 * Success time
